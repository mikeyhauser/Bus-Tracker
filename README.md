# Bus Tracker

[Application Deployed via Heroku](https://magic-school-bus-tracker.herokuapp.com/)

A web application that tracks the status of buses. Keep track of the children on the bus and gives bus drivers/admin a way to keep track of the children as well as any mechanical issues the bus has. As a bus driver or school admin I want an easy and centralized way to keep track of the children on the bus and also automatically inform parents of their whereabouts or any disruptions in the route.

This application is a simple note taker. It allows the user to take and store notes, as well as delete existing notes.
The application saves and retrieves note data from a JSON file.
